# DSA Adventure - Utsav

Welcome to **DSA Adventure - Utsav**!  
This repository is a personal collection of solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). All solutions are implemented in Java.

## About

- 📚 This repository serves as my learning journal and a resource for anyone interested in Java-based DSA problem solving.
- 📝 Each folder/file contains the problem statement (where possible) and the Java solution.
- 🔥 Problems are mostly from LeetCode but may occasionally include questions from other platforms or custom challenges.

## Structure

- `src/` - Contains all Java solution files, organized by topic or problem number.
- Each solution includes:
  - Problem name and link (if available)
  - Approach and explanation as comments
  - The Java code implementation

## Example

```
src/
 ├── arrays/
 │     └── TwoSum.java
 ├── strings/
 │     └── LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.java
 └── ...
```

Each file format:

```java
// Problem: Two Sum (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
// Approach: HashMap to store complement and index
// Solution:
public class TwoSum { ... }
```

## How to Use

- Browse the `src/` directory to find problems by topic or name.
- Read through the comments for explanations and approaches.
- Use the solutions as learning references or for practice.
